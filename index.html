        <h2>Utah</h2>
        <img src="images/utah.jpg" alt="Utah landscape">
        <p>Utah is a state in the western United States known for its stunning and diverse landscapes. From the towering, snow-capped peaks of the Wasatch Range to the otherworldly red rock formations of southern Utah, the state offers a dramatic mix of mountains, deserts, and canyons. Salt Lake City, the capital, lies near the Great Salt Lake. Utahs landscape is not just scenic, but also deeply tied to its cultural heritage, from Native American history to the early Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints pioneer settlers who shaped much of its development.</p>
